		<h1>National Children's Study - Ramsey County Location</h1>
			<div class="content-box">
			<h1>Community Advisory Board for the National Children's Study</h1>
			<h2>NCS COMMUNITY ADVISORY BOARD</h2>
			<ul class="list">
				<li>NCS sites are required to have a Community Advisory Board (CAB), 
					with a recommended size of 15-20 individuals. The University NCS 
					investigators consider a vital and engaged CAB to be fundamental 
					to the success of this complex, and promising study.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>MEMBERSHIP CRITERIA</h2>
			<p>
				The CAB should be multidisciplinary. Collectively, the CAB should 
				provide expertise in reproductive health, perinatal health, infant 
				and child health, surveillance, health care and social services 
				delivery, environmental health, public health outreach, MCH programs 
				and policies, and priority populations. Each CAB member should have 
				extensive professional memberships and diverse and relevant referral 
				networks through which NCS investigators may reach out to many 
				populations. CAB members should:		
			</p>
			<ul class="list">
				<li>Have a professional commitment to the well-being of women, 
					children and families and/or environmental safety; and
				</li>
				<li>Represent, or be connected to, a professional network that is 
					relevant to family health, child health, and/or environmental health; 
					and
				</li>
				<li>Have concern for, and understanding of, the needs of families in 
					Ramsey County; and
				</li>
				<li>Have a commitment to scientifically rigorous research practices 
					in order to promote evidence-based public health program 
					and policy development.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>CAB ACTIVITIES</h2>
			<p>CAB members provide consultative and other expert advice to the NCS 
				investigators in the following areas:
			</p>
			<ul class="list">
				<li>Development, and evaluation, of reports about community;</li>
				<li>Identification of long-term community members and local leaders;</li>
				<li>Methods for community engagement (e.g., education, information 
					dissemination, outreach forums, use of media/messages);
				</li>
				<li>Other public communications (e.g., website content, general media use).
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				CAB Members should be willing to act as "ambassadors" for the NCS: 
				They should want to apprise themselves of NCS progress in order to 
				represent the study to colleagues and communities. They should also 
				maintain awareness of NCS activities and contact NCS investigators 
				as they become aware of events that could influence study progress. 
				Members are not expected to engage in formal media activities		
			</p>
			<h2>LEVEL OF EFFORT</h2>
			<p>Members will:</p>
			<ul class="list">
				<li>Attend 2 to 4 one-hour meetings on the Twin Cities campus annually;</li>
				<li>Be responsive to occasional requests for individual consultation via e-mail or phone;</li>
				<li>Accept periodic (less than monthly) e-mail updates of study progress.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Note: CAB member time will be used efficiently. Given travel time to 
				the University for meetings, actual meeting time, and review of 
				periodic e-mails, it is estimated that the time commitment for a CAB 
				member will not exceed 10 hours during a calendar year.			
			</p>
			<h2>MEETINGS</h2>
			<p>
				Meetings will be co-chaired by Dr. Wendy Hellerstedt, an Associate 
				Professor in the Division of Epidemiology and Community Health, School 
				of Public Health, and Ms. Deb Hendricks, Manager, Healthy Families Section, 
				St. Paul-Ramsey County Department of Public Health.		
			</p>
			<h2>TERM LENGTH</h2>
			<p>The term commitment for CAB members is three years. Additional terms 
				are possible, if agreed to mutually.
			</p>
			<p>
				Dr. McGovern, Dr. Hellerstedt, and Ms. Hendricks will be responsible 
				for the final decisions about inviting new members, but they will seek 
				CAB advice about whom should be invited as new members. New members 
				will be invited initially as study neighborhoods are identified, 
				and later to succeed retiring members.		
			</p>
			<h2>COMPENSATION AND EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT</h2>
			<p>
				CAB members who are not state, county or University employees will 
				receive a stipend for participation in meetings. All non-University 
				employees will receive compensation for parking expenses. The contract 
				does not allow for compensation or reimbursement of University employees		
			</p>
