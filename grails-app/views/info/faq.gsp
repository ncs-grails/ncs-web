			<h2>Frequently Asked Questions about the Ramsey County Location</h2>
			<p>
				In 2007, the University of Minnesota was selected as one of the 22 
				Study Centers for the National Children's Study (NCS). The NCS is 
				designed to study the associations of health conditions of children 
				from birth to age 21 with various risk and protective factors. The 
				University will administer NCS protocols in Ramsey  County (one of 
				36 locations funded nationally). When it is fully operational, the 
				study is expected to have approximately 40 study centers (like the 
				University of Minnesota) recruiting volunteers from the planned 105 
				study locations (mostly counties) throughout the United States.		
			</p>
			<h2>WHY AND HOW IS THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA INVOLVED?</h2>
			<p>
			    <b>University expertise.</b> The University of Minnesota was awarded 
			    a contract to participate in the study in September 2007. It received 
			    the award based on a competitive process that examined: (1) expertise 
			    in public health, medicine, child development, and environmental 
			    health sciences; (2) the ability to collect and manage biologic and 
			    environmental specimens; and (3) the capacity to engage and maintain 
			    community participation over the more than 21 years of the study.		
			</p>
			<p>
			    <b>What will the University do?</b> For the first 5-6 years of the 
			    study, the University will be engaged in two major efforts: (1) working 
			    with community leaders to understand important elements of the study 
			    neighborhoods, including who the residents are, environmental quality, 
			    major stakeholders, important communications modalities, and relevant 
			    health and environmental concerns; and (2) participant recruitment 
			    and initial data collection.		
			</p>
			<p>
			    University researchers will enroll women at risk of pregnancy and 
			    women in early pregnancy over 4-5 years, beginning in 2010, with the 
			    goal of collecting data for at least 21 years from 1,000 Ramsey 
			    County children.		
			</p>
			<p>
			    Data collection will occur in the homes of pregnant women, at hospitals 
			    at which they deliver their babies, at University of Minnesota clinics.		
			</p>
			<h2>WHY AND HOW IS RAMSEY COUNTY INVOLVED?</h2>
			<p>
			    The national planners for the NCS identified 105 locations (mostly 
			    counties) around the country using a probability method, based on 
			    geography, demographics, number of births, birth outcomes, and other 
			    relevant data. Only these 105 locations are eligible for study 
			    participation. Each of the 105 locations was carefully selected to
			    ensure that collectively they provide an accurate snapshot of all of 
			    America's children. Ramsey  County was one of the locations identified 
			    and awarded to a Study  Center (the University of Minnesota).			
			</p>
			<h2>
				WHO ARE THE PARTNERS IN THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA'S RAMSEY COUNTY 
				NCS LOCATION?
			</h2>
			<p>
			    The University's large team of investigators - from the School of 
			    Public Health, the Medical School, and the Institute of Child 
			    Development - has formed partnerships for the National Children's 
			    Study with a number of organizations, including:			
			</p>
			<ul class="list">
				<li>St. Paul - Ramsey County Department of Public Health</li>
				<li>The National Opinion Research Center</li>
				<li>HealthPartners Research Foundation</li>
				<li>Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota</li>
				<li>Medica</li>
				<li>UCare</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
	        	The University's research team is also developing partnerships with 
	        	hospitals providing childbirth-related services to Ramsey County 
	        	residents, including United, Regions and St. John's hospitals.		
			</p>
			<p>
				The University's NCS team has also established two advisory boards:
			</p>
			<ul class="list">
				<li>
					An <g:link action="iab">Investigative Advisory Board</g:link> of 
					scientists and methodologists; and
				</li>
				<li>
					A <g:link action="cab">Community Advisory Board</g:link> of local 
					public health leaders, health care providers, legislators, and 
					maternal and child health professionals.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>WHO WILL THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS BE?</h2>
			<p>
				<b>How many participants will be enrolled?</b> Ramsey County, along 
				with each of the other 104 locations, aims to enroll 1,000 infants 
				in the study over a 4-year period.		
			</p>
			<p>
			    <b>When and how will participants be enrolled?</b> Recruitment in 
			    Ramsey County will begin late 2010. Participants will be identified 
			    primarily through a house-to-house survey conducted by survey 
			    professionals. Some participants may be identified through prenatal 
			    clinics or health plans.		
			</p>
			<p>
			    Who will the participants be? Initially, participants will include 
			    three groups:
			    (1) pregnant women;
			    (2) women who are planning a pregnancy;
			    (3) women who are fertile but are not planning a pregnancy.
			    People will be enrolled prior to pregnancy (where possible) and early 
			    in pregnancy to monitor the earliest possible influences on later 
			    infant, child, and youth health.			
			</p>
			<p>
			    Ultimately, participants of the study will be the offspring of the 
			    three groups of pre-pregnant/pregnant women. Researchers will follow 
			    the offspring from fetal life (i.e., during their mothers' pregnancies) 
			    until they are 21 years old.		
			</p>
			<p>
			    Not all Ramsey County residents will be involved in the study. To 
			    ensure a non-biased and representative sample, there will be a scientific 
			    and probability-based selection of specific census blocks for participation,
			    accomplished collaboratively by University and national consultants. 
			    Neither specific neighborhoods in Ramsey County nor specific 
			    individuals may request to participate in the study. Neighborhoods 
			    and participants must be selected using probability sampling to
			    assure a non-biased and representative sample.
			</p>
			<h2>IS IT POSSIBLE TO SUCCESSFULLY CONDUCT A STUDY THIS LARGE?</h2>
			<p>
			    Other long-term studies of mothers and their children have been 
			    successfully conducted in the U.S. and elsewhere. Among them are the 
			    Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children and the Minnesota 
			    Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, both of which followed 
			    children from fetal life onward. To our knowledge, this is the first 
			    study-and the largest-to focus so strongly on environmental exposures 
			    and on NCS-specified health outcomes.
			</p>
			<p>
			    U.S. investigators have experience with other long-term studies that 
			    have had a tremendous impact. For example, the Framingham Heart Study 
			    has followed individuals for decades. The knowledge gained from that 
			    study about health practices and treatments for heart disease has 
			    changed medical practices. The University of Minnesota and other NCS 
			    Study Centers were specifically chosen for their experience in
			    tracking large samples in health studies for many years.
			</p>
			<h2>
				DOES THE NATIONAL CHILDREN'S STUDY OFFER OPPORTUNITIES FOR OTHER 
				RESEARCH PROJECTS?
			</h2>
			<p>
			    At present, the focus of the University of Minnesota Study Center 
			    will be to conduct the tasks specified in the NCS contract with the 
			    funding agency. No funds are available for ancillary studies or 
			    scientific personnel beyond those needed for the community engagement 
			    and participant identification, recruitment, and initial data collection. 
			    It is possible that future research possibilities will become available.
			    If they do, their availability will be announced.
			</p>

			    http://www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov</a> provides study details, 
			    study locations, specific research hypotheses, and background on key 
			    risk and protective factors, as well as health outcomes, that will
