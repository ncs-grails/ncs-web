	<h3>Background Information</h3>
	<p>The National Children's Study is the largest and 
	most comprehensive study of children's health ever 
	conducted in the United States.</p>
	<h3>Study Overview</h3>
	<p>In September 2007, the University of Minnesota was 
		awarded a contract, valued at $14 million over five 
		years, to lead the National Children's Study at the 
		Ramsey County location.</p>
		<br/>
	<ul>
		<li>University study investigators will be supported 
			in the study through a number of partners, including 
			the St. Paul-Ramsey County Department of Health, 
			Minnesota Department of Health, National Opinion 
			Research Center, HealthPartners Research Foundation, 
			Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota and Medica, as 
			well as hospitals providing childbirth services to 
			Ramsey County residents, including United, Regions 
			and St. John's.</li>
		<li>Two advisory boards will also play important 
			roles in carrying out the study: An Investigative 
			Advisory Board of scientists and study methodologists; 
			and a Community Advisory Board of public health 
			leaders, health care providers, legislators and 
			maternal and child health professionals.</li>
	</ul>
	<br/>
	<p>In Ramsey County, the study aims to enroll 1,000 
	infants over a four-year period, beginning late 2010.</p>
	<br/>
	<ul>
		<li>To ensure a non-biased and representative 
			sample, individual households throughout Ramsey 
			County will be randomly selected and approached 
			about their interest in participation.</li>
		<li>Initially, participants will include: 
			pregnant women; women planning a pregnancy; 
			and women who are fertile but not planning 
			a pregnancy.</li>
		<li>The ultimate study participants will be 
			the offspring of these three groups.</li>
	</ul>
