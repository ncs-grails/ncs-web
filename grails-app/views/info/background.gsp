	  <h2>National Children's Study - Ramsey Location University of Minnesota</h2>

	  <p>The National Children's Study is the largest and most comprehensive
		study of children's health ever conducted in the United States.</p>
	  <p><a href="http://www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov/about/overview/Pages/default.aspx">
		  Study Overview</a></p>
	  <p>In September 2007, the University of Minnesota was awarded a
		contract, valued at &#36;14 million over five years, to lead the National
		Children's Study at the Ramsey County location.</p>

	  <ul class="list">
		<li>University study investigators will be supported in the study
		  through a number of partners, including the St. Paul-Ramsey County
		  Department of Health, Minnesota Department of Health, National
		  Opinion Research Center, HealthPartners Research Foundation, Blue
		  Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota and Medica, as well as hospitals
		  providing childbirth services to Ramsey County residents, including
		  United, Regions and St. John's.</li>
		<li>Two advisory boards will also play important roles in carrying
		  out the study: An Investigative Advisory Board of scientists and
		  study methodologists; and a Community Advisory Board of public
		  health leaders, health care providers, legislators and maternal
		  and child health professionals.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>In Ramsey County, the study aims to enroll 1,000 infants over a
		four-year period, beginning late 2010.</p>

	  <ul class="list">
		<li>To ensure a non-biased and representative sample, individual
		  households throughout Ramsey County will be randomly selected and
		  approached about their interest in participation.</li>
		<li>Initially, participants will include: pregnant women; women
		  planning a pregnancy; and women who are fertile but not planning
		  a pregnancy.</li>
		<li>The ultimate study participants will be the offspring of these
		  three groups.</li>
