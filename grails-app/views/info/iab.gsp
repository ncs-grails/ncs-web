		<h1>Investigative Advisory Board for the National Children's Study</h1>
		<h2>NCS INVESTIGATIVE ADVISORY BOARD</h2>
		<p>
			The University Investigative Advisory Board (IAB) is intended to provide 
			advice to the NCS investigators on study design, methods, and conduct. 
			The NCS is a federal contract. It is distinct from an investigator-initiated 
			study in many ways. A significant difference is that investigators 
			have limited input on study design, methods, and conduct. While it is 
			critical that each NCS site follow a prescribed protocol, to assure 
			consistency across sites, there will be opportunities for site-specific 
			input in some areas. For that reason, a vital and engaged IAB will be 
			fundamental to the success of this complex, and promising study.		
		</p>
		<span><g:link action="background">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</g:link></span>
		<h2>MEMBERSHIP CRITERIA</h2>
		<p>
			The IAB should be multidisciplinary. Collectively, the IAB should 
			provide expertise in reproductive health, perinatal health, infant 
			and child health, surveillance, health care and social services 
			delivery, environmental health, laboratory medicine, public health 
			outreach, MCH programs and policies, and priority populations. 
			IAB members should:		
		</p>
		<ul class="list">
			<li>Have a professional commitment to the well-being of women, 
				children and families and/or environmental safety; and
			</li>
			<li>
				Represent, or be connected to, a professional network that is 
				relevant to family health, child health, and/or environmental 
				health; and			
			</li>
			<li>
				Have expertise in one, or more, of the methodological (e.g., sampling, 
				health-care provider relations, longitudinal study design, surveillance, 
				data collection, analysis) or content (e.g., reproductive health, 
				perinatal health, infant health, pediatrics, maternal and child 
				nutrition, environmental health) areas of relevance to the NCS; and
			</li>
			<li>
				Have a commitment to scientifically rigorous research practices 
				in order to promote evidence-based public health program 
				and policy development.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>IAB ACTIVITIES</h2>
		<p>
			IAB members provide consultative and other expert advice to the NCS 
			investigators in the following areas, as requested by the investigators:			
		</p>
		<ul class="list">
			<li>Sampling, recruitment, and retention of participants;</li>
			<li>Data collection methods;</li>
			<li>Dissemination of study information to scientific audiences.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			IAB Members should be willing to act as "ambassadors" for the NCS: 
			They should want to apprise themselves of NCS progress in order to 
			represent the study to colleagues and communities. They should also 
			maintain awareness of NCS activities and contact NCS investigators 
			as they become aware of events that could influence study progress.		
		</p>
		<h2>LEVEL OF EFFORT</h2>
		<p>Members will:</p>
		<ul class="list">
			<li>Attend 2 to 4 one-hour meetings on the Twin Cities campus annually;</li>
			<li>Be responsive to occasional requests for individual consultation via e-mail or phone;</li>
			<li>Accept periodic (less than monthly) e-mail updates of study progress.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<b>Note:</b>The investigators will use IAB member time efficiently. 
			Given actual meeting time and review of periodic e-mails, it is 
			estimated that the time commitment for an IAB member will not exceed 
			10 hours during a calendar year.
		</p>
		<h2>MEETINGS</h2>
		<p>
			Meetings will be chaired by Dr. Patricia McGovern, the Principal 
			Investigator of the study and a Professor in the Division of 
			Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health. Meeting 
			schedules will be set with sufficient lead time to allow maximum 
			participation. All meetings will be held on the Twin Cities campus.		
		</p>
		<h2>TERM LENGTH</h2>
		<p>
			The term commitment for IAB members is three years. Additional terms 
			are possible, if agreed to mutually.
		</p>
		<p>
			Dr. McGovern will be responsible for the final decisions about 
			inviting new members, and will seek IAB advice about whom should be 
			invited as new members. New members will be invited if gaps in the 
			IAB are noted and to succeed retiring members.
		</p>
		<h2>COMPENSATION AND EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT</h2>
		<p>
			IAB members who are not state, county or University employees will 
			receive a stipend for participation in meetings. All non-University 
			employees will receive compensation for parking expenses. The contract 
			does not allow for compensation or reimbursement of University employees.		
		</p>

			IAB members should feel free to contact any member of the study staff.
