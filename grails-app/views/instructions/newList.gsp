	<h2>Instructions to Request a New List</h2>
	<p>Send an e-mail the <strong>NCS IS Working Group</strong> 
		<a href="mailto:NCS_UMN_InfoSysTeam@lists.ncs.umn.edu">
			NCS_UMN_InfoSysTeam@lists.ncs.umn.edu</a></p>
	<h3>INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING ITEMS IN YOUR REQUEST:</h3>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>A brief description of the list or the purpose of the list.</li>
		<li>The names and e-mail addresses for the members of the list.</li>
		<li>The name of the <strong>List Authority</strong> (person responsible managing the list members).</li>
		<li>Proposed name of the list.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The <strong>NCS IS Working Group</strong> will review the request 
		and decide if the list should be created or 
		whether a combination of other lists will work. 
		In either case the requestor will be notified 
		of the group's decision. If the list is approved 
		the <strong>NCS IS Working Group</strong> will 
		notify the <strong>Site</strong> and 
		<strong>List Administrators</strong> who will 
		create and populate the list. When the list is 
		ready for use the <strong>List Administrator</strong> 
		will send an e-mail to the <strong>List 
		Authority<strong>. Once the list is created all changes 
		to the list should be e-mailed directly to the 
		List Administrator 
		(<a href="mailto:NCS_UMN_ListAdmin@lists.ncs.umn.edu">NCS_UMN_ListAdmin@lists.ncs.umn.edu</a>)
		 - see instructions for requesting changes to the list.
