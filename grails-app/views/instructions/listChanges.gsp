	<h2>Request Changes to and Email Distribution List</h2>
	<p>E-mail the <strong>List Administrators</strong> 
		distribution list 
		(<a href="mailto:NCS_UMN_ListAdmin@lists.ncs.umn.edu">NCS_UMN_ListAdmin@lists.ncs.umn.edu</a>)
		with the changes you want made. Each list has 
		a <strong>List Authority</strong> who manages members 
		included on their list. A <strong>List Authority</strong> 
		can request changes for lists for which they are the 
		<strong>List Authority</strong> (not other lists). When 
		appropriate, the <strong>List Administrators</strong> 
		will get the <strong>List Authority's</strong> 
		permission to make the requested changes.</p>
	
	<h3>These are the changes you can request:</h3>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Add a person / email address (<strong>requires List Authority permission</strong>)
			<ul><li>In your request, include the new name and email address to be added</li></ul>
		</li>
		<li>Delete a person / email address (<strong>requires List Authority permission</strong>)
			<ul><li>In your request, include the name and email address to be deleted</li></ul>
		</li>
		<li>Make a correction to a person's name / email address (<strong>requires 
			List Authority permission</strong> unless you are requesting 
			a change to your own address )
			<ul><li>In your request, include the name /and/ both the old and new email address</li></ul>
